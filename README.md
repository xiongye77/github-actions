# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)  and  OWASP Top Ten
The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the top ten most critical web application security risks. It is compiled by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit organization focused on improving software security.

The OWASP Top Ten is updated periodically to reflect the evolving landscape of web application security threats. The list is intended to raise awareness about common vulnerabilities and provide guidance on how to mitigate them effectively. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, security professionals, and organizations to prioritize their efforts in securing web applications.

The OWASP Top Ten typically includes vulnerabilities such as:

Injection: This refers to security flaws that occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to execution of unintended commands or access to unauthorized data.

Broken Authentication: This involves security weaknesses in authentication and session management, which can allow attackers to compromise user accounts, steal session tokens, or impersonate users.

Sensitive Data Exposure: This refers to vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information, to unauthorized parties.

XML External Entities (XXE): This occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser, leading to disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.

Broken Access Control: This involves security flaws that allow users to access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions, bypassing access controls.

Security Misconfiguration: This refers to insecure configurations of web applications, web servers, frameworks, or platforms, which can lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, or other security issues.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to theft of session cookies, redirection to malicious websites, or other attacks.

Insecure Deserialization: This involves security weaknesses in deserialization processes, which can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other attacks.

Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: This refers to security risks associated with the use of outdated or vulnerable components, libraries, or frameworks in web applications.

Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This involves inadequate logging and monitoring of security events, which can hinder detection and response to security incidents.

By addressing the vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP Top Ten, organizations can significantly improve the security posture of their web applications and better protect sensitive data and resources from cyber threats.



# Relationship between Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and OWASP Top Ten


Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a method of analyzing source code, bytecode, or binary code to find security vulnerabilities that may exist within an application's codebase. It is typically performed during the development phase of the software development lifecycle.

The relationship between SAST and the OWASP Top Ten is primarily about how SAST tools can help identify and mitigate the security risks outlined in the OWASP Top Ten. Here's how SAST and the OWASP Top Ten are related:

Identification of Vulnerabilities: SAST tools analyze source code to identify potential vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and others, which are part of the OWASP Top Ten. By scanning the codebase, SAST tools can detect security weaknesses that could lead to the exploitation of these OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.

Prioritization of Remediation Efforts: Since the OWASP Top Ten represents the most critical web application security risks, organizations often prioritize remediating vulnerabilities related to these risks. SAST tools can help prioritize remediation efforts by identifying which vulnerabilities in the codebase correspond to the OWASP Top Ten.

Compliance with Best Practices: Following the OWASP Top Ten recommendations is considered a best practice in web application security. By using SAST tools to identify and address vulnerabilities related to the OWASP Top Ten, organizations can demonstrate compliance with industry standards and best practices for secure software development.

Integration with Development Workflow: SAST tools can be integrated into the development workflow to automate security testing as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. By incorporating SAST scans into the development process, organizations can detect and fix security issues early in the software development lifecycle, reducing the likelihood of OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities making their way into production.

Overall, SAST tools play a crucial role in helping organizations address the security risks outlined in the OWASP Top Ten by identifying vulnerabilities in the codebase and facilitating their remediation during the development process. is a method of analyzing source code, bytecode, or binary code to find security vulnerabilities that may exist within an application's codebase.
